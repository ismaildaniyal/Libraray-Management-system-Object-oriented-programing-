# **Library Management System - Object-Oriented Programming**

## **Description**
The Library Management System is a robust application implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. This project highlights the effective use of OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and function overriding to model and manage library operations efficiently.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Incorporates core OOP principles for modular and maintainable code.
- **Base and Derived Classes:** Utilizes base classes like `LibraryItem` and `LibraryMember`, with derived classes for specific entities (e.g., books, DVDs, students, faculty).
- **Polymorphism:** Enables flexible handling of various library items and members.
- **Efficient Operations:** Supports borrowing and returning library items with due date management.
- **Extensibility:** Easily expandable to include new features or types of library items and members.

---

## **System Requirements**
Ensure the following prerequisites are met:
1. **C++ Compiler:** A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC) to compile the source code.
2. **Development Environment:** Any C++ IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or VS Code).

## **Installation & Usage**

### **Installation:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismaildaniyal/Libraray-Management-system-Object-oriented-programing-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.

### **Usage:**
1. Run the compiled executable.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage library operations:
   - Add library items or members.
   - Borrow and return items.
   - View library inventory or member details.
