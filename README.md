# Libraray-Management-system-Object-oriented-programing-
Library Management System implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and function overriding


A simple Library Management System implemented in C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project leverages concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and function overriding to model the relationships and behaviors of library entities.

**Features:**

Object-oriented design for better code organization and readability.

Implementation of base classes such as LibraryItem and LibraryMember.

Derived classes for specific types of library items (e.g., books, DVDs) and members (e.g., students, faculty).

Polymorphic behavior for handling different types of library items and members.

Efficient borrowing and returning of library items with due dates.

**How to Use:**
Clone the repository.
Compile the source code.
Run the executable.
